Pybadges
========

What is this ?
--------------

Just a very quick and dirty Python script to generate badges for
conference attendees and speakers.

It requires a `CSV` file as input, with the following format:

    firstname lastname,company,role
    firstname lastname,company,role
    firstname lastname,company,role
    firstname lastname,company,role

Typically `role` can be `speaker`, `attendee`, `organizer` or something
like that.

It also requires a background image used for the badges.

Typical usage:

    ./pybadges -i input.csv -o output.pdf -b background.png
